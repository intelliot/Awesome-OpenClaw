# Awesome-OpenClaw
A curated collection of prompts, tips, and tricks to enhance OpenClaw and unlock its full potential

OpenClaw has a tendency to hallucinate a lot, which can cost significantly in API usage. I now link the .openclaw directory directly in Cursor, write my scripts there, and then have OpenClaw execute them. This approach has noticeably reduced costs and prevents OpenClaw from repeatedly rebuilding and breaking everything.

I put in its soul md that it always verifies accuracy of responses before responding and in user md that the most important thing about me is I value accuracy even if it requires additional work/tokens. that somehow seems to have helped.

I had an issue where two instances were installed causing confusion. You may be able to figure this out by discussing with the agent. 

I’m having this too - turning complicated tasks into sub task delivered by individual agents, with specific skills, has helped.  

Still, I am having issues with it saying something will work (like a mission hub/dashboard), and it doesn’t after a few feedback rounds.
